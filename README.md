## 🌟 Overview

Indian Sign Language is the primary mode of communication for millions of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals across India, yet very few real-time tools exist to bridge the gap between ISL users and non-signers. This project addresses that gap.

The system works entirely through a **standard webcam** — no special hardware required. It captures live video, extracts skeletal and facial landmarks frame by frame using **MediaPipe Holistic**, and passes 30-frame sequences into a **Bidirectional LSTM** deep learning model to classify which ISL sign is being performed. Confirmed signs are assembled into a sentence, which is then grammatically refined using **Groq LLaMA 3.1** and spoken aloud via **Google Text-to-Speech** in the user's chosen Indian language.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- A working webcam
- Windows / macOS / Linux

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/architinit/Real-Time-Indic-Sign-Language-to-Speech-Translator.git
cd Real-Time-Indic-Sign-Language-to-Speech-Translator
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up your Groq API key

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Get a free key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com). The app works without it (falls back to rule-based grammar) but LLM correction gives better output.

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Option A — Web App (Recommended)

```bash
python app.py
```

Open **`http://localhost:5000`** in Chrome or Firefox.

1. Click **Start Camera** — webcam activates server-side
2. Perform an ISL sign in front of the camera
3. The detected word appears live in the **Detected Sign** panel
4. Words accumulate in the **Building Sentence** panel
5. Wait 2.5 seconds (auto-finalise) or click **Confirm**
6. Click **Speak** to hear it in your chosen language

> On the same WiFi network, other devices can access the app at `http://<your-local-IP>:5000`

### Option B — Desktop Script

A standalone OpenCV window — same pipeline, no browser needed.

```bash
python scripts/sentence_builder.py
```

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `ENTER` | Finalise sentence and speak |
| `B` | Undo last word |
| `C` | Clear sentence |
| `1–7` | Switch language (En/Hi/Bn/Ta/Te/Mr/Gu) |
| `Q` | Quit |

### Option C — Word Tester

Test all 50 signs one by one with a reference video side-by-side.

```bash
python scripts/word_tester.py
```

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SPACE` | Mark sign as passed, move to next |
| `F` | Flag sign as failing, move to next |
| `Q` | Quit and print summary of flagged signs |

## 🧠 Training Your Own Model

The pre-trained model (`models/isl_model_solo.keras`) was trained on the project team's personal ISL recordings. Since sign language recognition is **signer-dependent** (hand size, signing style, and camera angle all affect accuracy), training on your own recordings will give better results.

```bash
# Step 1 — Record 30 sequences per word via webcam
python scripts/personal_collector.py

# Step 2 — Augment to expand the dataset
python scripts/augment_personal_data.py

# Step 3 — Train the BiLSTM
python scripts/train_personal_only.py
```

The new model is saved automatically to `models/isl_model_solo.keras`.

## 📦 Dataset

The active model is trained entirely on **personally recorded ISL gesture data** — 30 sequences per word class, recorded via webcam and augmented to expand the dataset.

The **[INCLUDE dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4010759)** (4,292 clips, 263 word signs, IIT Bombay) was used as a reference to select the 50 word classes covered by this project. It is not used for training and is not required to run the project.
